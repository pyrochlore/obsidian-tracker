# Frontmatter Lists
This option is helpful for vaultkeepers who want to track multiple habits (targets) using the same custom YAML property. 

## Example outputs
Each of the outputs below is generated by searching frontmatter for `habits: ` , then checking the list of values for the presence of a single habit, ex: `yoga`, `piano`, or `spanish`.  

```tracker
searchType: frontmatterlist
searchTarget: habits[yoga]
folder: diary
startDate: 2026-02-01
endDate: 2026-02-28
datasetName: Yoga
month:
```



```tracker
searchType: frontmatterlist
searchTarget: habits[spanish]
folder: diary
startDate: 2026-02-01
endDate: 2026-02-28
datasetName: Spanish
month:
	color: orange
```
```tracker
searchType: frontmatterlist
searchTarget: habits[piano]
folder: diary
startDate: 2026-02-01
endDate: 2026-02-28
datasetName: Piano
month:
	color: lightblue
```

```tracker
searchType: frontmatterlist
searchTarget: habits[piano]
folder: diary
startDate: 2026-02-01
endDate: 2026-02-28
summary:
	template: "Total count: {{sum()}}"
```



### Testing

**Bracket test**: Single-line lists can be surrounded by square brackets, but it's not required. (Trailing commas won't break anything either.)
- 2/9: `habits: []`
- 2/10: `habits: [piano]`
- 2/12: `habits: [yoga, spanish]`
- 2/16: `habits: `
- 2/8: `habits: spanish`
- 2/15: `habits: yoga, spanish, piano`

.

**Case test**:  Values stored in frontmatter lists are **case insensitive** for this plugin, mirroring the behavior of tags. In the examples above, `yoga` and `Yoga` should be treated the same. 

If search targets are case insensitive, then both 2/14 and 2/17 will be highlighted on the `month:` output for `habit[yoga]` when the examples vault is viewed in Obsidian. 

.

**Multi-line list test**: If multi-line lists are working, then 2/14 will be highlighted on each of the calendars above when the examples vault is viewed in Obsidian.
